# Welcome to CQL (City – Quality of Life!)


CQL is a Ruby-based CLI program that allows users to search and browse a variety of quality of life (QOL) metrics on different cities.

Do you want to move to a new city? Are you curious about you how your current city measures up? CQL is here to help you decide which city you should call home.

### navigating find

Users can enter a city name to search QOL metric values (a numerical score out of 10). Once you enter a city name, the program outputs a list of cities with similar matches so you can select the one you intended!

 ** Please note that the program limits return choices to 25 cities. Type the full name of the city to help the search function 👍🏻

Quality of life metrics data are available for major urban areas. If users select a suburb city, they receive the quality of life metrics for the greater urban area that the suburb belongs to as displayed below.

Users can choose to add the city to their short list to save for later!


### navigating list

Users can view their current short list of cities they saved at any time by typing "list" from the main menu.

Within this features users can compare the cities they have saved in their short list by each of the 17 QOL metrics.

Users can also remove individual cities from their list of saved cities or they can delete the entire short list.
