# Welcome to CQL (City ‚Äì Quality of Life!)


CQL is a Ruby-based CLI program that allows users to search and browse a variety of quality of life (QOL) metrics on different cities.

Do you want to move to a new city? Are you curious about you how your current city measures up? CQL is here to help you decide which city you should call home.

### navigating find

Users can enter a city name to search QOL metric values (a numerical score out of 10). Once you enter a city name, the program outputs a list of cities with similar matches so you can select the one you intended!

 ** Please note that the program limits return choices to 25 cities. Type the full name of the city to help the search function üëçüèª

Quality of life metrics data are available for major urban areas. If users select a suburb city, they receive the quality of life metrics for the greater urban area that the suburb belongs to as displayed below.
